 Linux kernel development process currently consists of a few different
 main kernel "branches" and lots of different subsystem-specific kernel
 branches.  These different branches are:
-  - main 2.6.x kernel tree
-  - 2.6.x.y -stable kernel tree
-  - 2.6.x -git kernel patches
+  - main 3.x kernel tree
+  - 3.x.y -stable kernel tree

   - subsystem specific kernel trees and patches
